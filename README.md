# Breast-Cancer-Detection-
Exploratory Data Analysis for the Prediction of Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.

After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.

Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.

# Two common types are discussed in this Project
**Melignant
**Benign

A tumor can be benign (not dangerous to health) or malignant (has the potential to be dangerous). Benign tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal in appearance, they grow slowly, and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous.

# Machine Learning and Breast Cancer Detection
Machine learning is the process in which our system learns something by it's own without being Explicitely Programmed.

In this Project we used Machine Learning Algorithm to find the Pattern from the Data and prected whether Person is suffering from
cancer or not.
## The problem is of Classification Part.
### Classification means to distinguish between True or False(yes or No)(0 or 1)
## Algorithm Used:
**Logistic Regression
**Decision Tree
**Random Forest(Classifier)
**Support Vector Machine(Classifier)
**K Nearest Neighbors
** Naive Byes

### KNN gave kind of Better Prediction Score or say Accuracy
## Some Feature Engineering helped our data to get relief from Outliers.

### Grapical Representation Helps users to get information and understand without any technical backgroung
### At last User can Enjoy real world experience using their own data and predict whether they have breast cancer or not.

Thank You
